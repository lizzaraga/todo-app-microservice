# Simple To-Do App

A **Simple To-Do Application** built with **ASP.NET Core** that features JWT authentication, secure task management, and a centralized API Gateway. This project showcases modern development practices by starting with a **monolithic architecture** and transitioning into a **microservices architecture** for better scalability and modularity.

---

## üí° Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization via the Auth-Service.
- **Microservices Architecture**:
    - **Auth-Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
    - **Todo-Service**: Securely handles to-do entries and task management.
    - **API Gateway**: Central entry point for routing requests to the respective services.
- **Database**: Utilizes **SQLite** with **EF Core** for seamless data persistence and automatic migrations.
- **Service Discovery**: Integrated **Consul** for service registration and health checks.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI for easy testing and exploration of API endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Includes global exception handling middleware for consistent and comprehensive error responses.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

---

### Running the Monolithic Application
1. Switch to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project ./src/ApiGateway
   ```
3. Access Swagger on: `http://localhost:<port>/swagger`

---

### Running the Microservices Architecture
1. Switch to the `microservices` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout microservices
   ```
2. Use Docker to build and run the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access Swagger of the API Gateway on: `http://localhost:<gateway-port>/swagger`
